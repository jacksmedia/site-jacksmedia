# KuCoin Centralized Exchange

## Why use a CEX?

Thought this was all about decentralization, anon? Well ideally, of course it is! We all want to escape from the status quo and live in a world that's not controlled by banks. Yet there's no DEX to swap Ravencoin into EGLD, not in February 2023. So until this option exists, let's utilize the best option at hand, [KuCoin Exchange \(🇭🇰\)](https://www.kucoin.com/ucenter/signup?rcode=r3JHB3C&lang=en_US&utm_source=friendInvite).

You can also find $RVN on [Binance USA \(🗺️\), join here if applicable & interested](https://accounts.binance.us/en/register?ref=52116724). This is another great and fast way to convert $RVN to $EGLD, and allow your mining rig to augment your staking on MultiversX.


## How to Swap $RVN to $EGLD
1. Get Receiving Address from your KuCoin app / acct
2. Use this address in your mining script
3. Move $RVN funds from Main to Trading, if needed 
4. Use Swap feature of app to sell $RVN to $USDT
5. Buy $EGLD with the $USDT coins you just sold the $RVN for
5. Move $EGLD funds from Trading to Main, if needed
6. Send $EGLD to your xPortal wallet address
7. (Optional: Stake EGLD, guide follows this, soon)

Stay tuned for some visual guides to these steps.


## Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe

Alternatively, you can keep your $RVN under your own control with the free, "Your Keys Your Coins" [Trust Wallet app](https://trustwallet.com). It may also be possible to use a hardware wallet to store your Ravencoin, but this author cannot confirm this method at this time.
