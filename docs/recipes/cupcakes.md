# Chocolate Cupcakes, GF & DF

These gluten free & dairy free cupcakes use tea to add some flavor depth. It's possible to substitute apple sauce for eggs and make them fully vegan, if you wish.

This recipe presumes you have silicone cupcake trays: it's not been tested with traditional paper cupcake liners in a metal tray. Two bowls are also needed (three if you make the frosting, too).

This will make a lot of cupcakes! About 24 normal sized (7cm diameter), or 12 normal and 48 small (3 cm diameter)!

## Ingredients & Steps to Create
- 2 cups white sugar (480 ml)
- 1¾ cups all-purpose flour (420 ml)
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder (180 ml)
- 1½ teaspoons baking powder (7.5 ml)
- 1½ teaspoons baking soda (7.5 ml)
- 1 teaspoon salt (5 ml)
~ Mix these dry ingredients together in the large bowl
~ Preheat your oven to 350F & boil water for the tea

~ In another bowl...
- 2 large eggs (90 ml) (or 180 ml apple sauce I guess)
- 1 cup milk (240 ml)
- ½ cup vegetable oil (120 ml)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract (10 ml)
~ Mix milk, eggs, vanilla, & oil on medium speed-- or by hand!
~ Add this mix to the dry mix in the big bowl, stir well

- 1 cup fresh brewed hot tea (240 ml) or boiling water if you prefer less complex flavor
(a cup of tea takes about 6 minutes to brew)
~ Add the boiling water/tea carefully; stir slowly
~ Use a ladle to pour this into the cupcake trays

Bake cupcakes for 30 minutes: allow to cool, then invert and remove from trays.

Optionally, top them with one of the insanely simple frostings listed below.


# GF & DF Cream Cheese Frosting
- ½ cup almond or cashew cream cheese
- ½ cup plant butter
- 2 cups of cane sugar or similar sugar

## Steps to Create
1. Get the butter to room temperature, or microwave it for about 20 seconds to make it very soft but not yet liquid.
2. Mix the butter and cream 'cheese' together by hand in a small bowl. Fork or flexible spatula is a good tool.
3. Add 1/2 cup of sugar at a time to this. Flexible spatula is a good tool.
4. Optionally, add food coloring or flavoring oils.


# GF & DF Chocolate Frosting
- 1 cup confectioners' sugar (180 ml)
- 8 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (120 ml)
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature (120 ml)
- 6.33 tablespoons milk (100 ml)
- 1.33 teaspoon vanilla extract (5 ml)

1. Just mix these together, in order! That's it!

Caveat: Use soft butter, see the above recipe.

This one uses more butter versus plant based cream cheese, and it might be possible to leave out the cocoa and flavor it with oils but... that's not something we can vouch for at this time.

## Enjoy these plant-based pastries!
