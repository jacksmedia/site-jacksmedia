# who & what

First off, my professional background.

1. Some early jobs I worked: buffet runner in a fancy hotel, movie projectionist, bank teller.
2. I enlisted in the U.S. military after 9/11, was trained to perform a Top Secret IT job, hence...
3. I lived in both S.Korea and Japan & enjoyed exploring their cuisine and tourist spots.
4. I freelanced in web development (JS, AWS), from 2018 onwards;
5. Began working in web3 (blockchain + Discord) in 2021;
6. Created graphics & lore, from 2022 onwards;
7. & Started freelancing in cloud software engineering (Python, AWS) in 2023.
8. Leveraging AI tools to create content and improve my productivty since 2023.

I currently live in Oregon, in one of the most progressive cities in the USA. You may have heard about the racial justice protests that occurred here during the early COVID years, and you may know us for our homeless crisis more than for our incredible city parks and restaurants, but the same policies and public attitudes that created the latter have also precipitated the former. I grew up in the Pennsylvania mountains a few hours outside of New York, so despite the drawbacks of life in this Pacific Northwest city, I vastly prefer it to the cold, mercantile Northeast of my youth.

My 5.5 years in the US Air Force were a whirlwind of travel and learning (mostly on the job, but sometimes on the weekend), plus my first forays into tourism and blogging. Those archives are strewn across flickr and facebook, but maybe I'll collect them together again someday.
